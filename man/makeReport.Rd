makeReport(df, msddf, titleStr, subStr)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{imported TrackMate data with correct units}

\item{msddf}{MSD summary = output from calculateMSD()}

\item{titleStr}{string used as the title for the report}

\item{subStr}{string used as the subtitle for the report}

\value{
patchwork ggplot
}
\description{
Generate several plots to visualise TrackMate data and generate a report.
Note that the units are hard-coded as um and s.
The use of um is because ggsave does not currently save unicode to PDF reliably.
