\value{
patchwork ggplot or a list of patchwork ggplot and data frame of summary data
}
\description{
Generate several plots to visualise TrackMate data and generate a report.
The use of um is because ggsave does not currently save unicode to PDF reliably.
The code is switchable to accommodate making a "report" (one dataset) or a "summary" (several related datasets combined)
