Analysis of TrackMate XML outputs in R.

[TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) is a single-particle tracking plugin for ImageJ/Fiji.
The standard output from a tracking session is in TrackMate XML format.

The goal of this R package is to import all of the data associated with the final filtered tracks in TrackMate for further analysis and visualization in R.

**This package is under development and should not be considered stable until its first release.**

## Installation

Install TrackMateR using devtools

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("quantixed/TrackMateR")
```

## An Example

A basic example is to load one XML file and analyse it.

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(TrackMateR)
# an example file is provided, otherwise use file.choose()
xmlPath <- system.file("extdata", "ExampleTrackMateData.xml", package="TrackMateR")
# read the TrackMate XML file into R using
tmObj <- readTrackMateXML(XMLpath = xmlPath)
# have a look at the tracks
plot_tm_allTracks(tmObj)
```

Let's go a bit further.

TrackMateR can generate several different types of plot individually using commands. An alternative is to make a report.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# perhaps the data we loaded in was not scaled properly
# Pixel size is 0.04 um and original data was 1 pixel, xyscalar = 0.04
tmObj <- correctTrackMateData(dataList = tmObj, xyscalar = 0.04, xyunit = "um")
# we can get a data frame of the correct TrackMate data 
tmDF <- tmObj[[1]]
# and a data frame of calibration information
calibrationDF <- tmObj[[2]]
# we can calculate mean squared displacement
msdObj <- calculateMSD(df = tmDF, method = "ensemble", N = 3, short = 8)
# and jump distance
jdObj <- calculateJD(dataList = tmObj, deltaT = 1)
# and look at the density of tracks
tdDF <- calculateTrackDensity(dataList = tmObj, radius = 1.5)
# if we extract the name of the file
fileName <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(xmlPath))
# we can send all these things to makeSummaryReport() to get a nice report of our dataset
makeSummaryReport(tmList = tmObj, msdList = msdObj, jumpList = jdObj, tddf = tdDF,
titleStr = "Report", subStr = fileName, auto = FALSE)
```
